# Description
The goal of this repository is to showcase the benefits of utilizing Micro-Frontends architecture in building large scale applications.  

## Abstract

Microservices have recently gained attention and hype from the dev community. However, most of the topics and discussions have focused on building back-end systems with high availability and scalability. The current trend is to write a rich browser single page application that connects on an API gateway. Over time, the front-end layer developed by several teams grows and becomes more difficult to maintain which results to a Frontend Monolith.

To solve the issue, big companies came up with an idea to build a web app that is composed by modules owned by independent teams (Often aligned with the bounded context division in a Microservice Architecture). This approach gives teams an end-to-end control on building features (persistence layer to front-end layer). This approach is called Micro Frontends.
